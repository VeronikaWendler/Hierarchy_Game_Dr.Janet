		<h1>Letter of Information and Consent Form</h1>
		<h>Study title: Human decision-making</h>
		<hr>
        <p><b>Who is running this study?</b>
        You are being invited to participate in a research study directed by Dr. Anita Tusche (Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology, Queen’s University, Ontario, Canada). The study is being sponsored by Queen’s University and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). It has been reviewed for ethical compliance by the Queen’s University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board.</p>
        <p><b>What is the study about?</b>
        The purpose of this project is to better understand the distinct processes that drive differences in human decision making across people, contexts and time using computer questionnaires and tasks. We will compare these different measures that characterize individuals’ choice process. The overall aim of the research is to provide basic-science data that will help us better understand the processes that drive variance in human decision-making. This consent form is for participating in online behavioral studies that are part of this research.</p>
		<p><b>What is involved?</b>
		You will be asked to complete an online experiment. This experiment will take approximately 30-35 min and will have the following components:</p>
		<p class="tab">– Interactions with other people. You will be asked to play a computerized game with another (anonymous) person. We will also ask you to choose between different allocations of monetary units.</p>
		<p class="tab">– Tests and questionnaires. These tests will measure things like memory, attention, mood, traits, and attitudes.</p>
		<p><b>Is my participation voluntary?</b>
        Yes. Although it be would be greatly appreciated if you would answer all material as frankly as possible, you are not obliged to answer any material that you find objectionable or that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you are uncomfortable at any time you may quit the experiment or take a break. The information on how to quit the experiment can be found in the instructions before the experiment starts. You are welcome to do so at any time, for any reason. If you decide afterward that you do not want us to use your data, you may email us and ask to have your data removed from the study.</p>
		<p><b>Are there any benefits?</b>
        Our research has no direct benefits to you. The research in general will provide further information about mechanisms and motivations that drive the variance in behaviour across people and contexts (i.e., advancement of knowledge).</p> 
		<p><b>Are there any risks?</b>
        There are no known risks involved with the tasks you will be asked to complete.</p>
        <p><b>What are the eligibility criteria?</b>
        You must be at least 18 years old and not older than 45 an English native-speaker with normal (or corrected-to-normal) vision. You must have no present or historical diagnoses of psychological conditions or neurological conditions.</p>
 		<p><b>What payment will I receive?</b>
        All participants are compensated equally for their participation in all tasks of the study. You will be compensated at a rate of $9 USD/$11.50 CAD/£7 per hour for your participation. In addition, in some of the choice tasks we are interested in your personal preferences. Thus, in these tasks there is no right or wrong answer. We will randomly select one of your choices at the end of the study and you might get some additional small funds depending on your choice in the particular task. Prior to the respective computer task (during the instruction and practice trials), we will go over the potential payoffs of your choice options in great detail and we will remind you that one trial will be randomly selected by the computer and implemented according to your choice in the selected trial. If the random selection of one choice trial is not explicitly mentioned, that means that this won’t apply to the choice task in your current study.</p>       
		<p><b>Confidentiality.</b>
        Any information from this study in which you might be identified will be confidential. You will not be asked to disclose your own name or other personal information (e.g. contact information) in any forms or fields in this study. Your records will only be available to the study investigators, the Queen's University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board (HSREB) and regulatory or funding agencies as required by law. Your data may be presented in publications, conferences and talks in an anonymous form, such that it would be impossible to identify you from data presented. Confidentiality will be maintained at all times. Thus, if information generated by this study is published, you will never be identified by name.</p>
 		<p>Digital data collected from this study will be kept in Dr. Tusche's laboratory at Queen’s University. Data will be stored on a secure, password-protected computer system and identified only with the date and a subject code.  No unauthorized person will have access to the data generated by this study. Your digital data will never be linked with you by name but only a numeric code. To help us ensure confidentiality, please do not disclose your own name on any forms in this experiment including the consent form. Your data may also be reanalyzed by qualified researchers during future research projects, but note that these researchers will never have access to your name or any other personal information.</p>
		<p><b>What happens to my records after the experiment?</b>
        Data collected from this study will be processed and stored in a world-class data center facility in Ireland, EU using the millisecond service (https://www.millisecond.com/) and on a secure, password-protected computer in Dr. Tusche's laboratory at Queen’s University in Ontario, CA. Your data files will be encrypted over the network using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Researchers in the Queen’s Neuroeconomics Laboratory can download the data files in deidentified form (which means that your data will be linked to a numeric code) and stored on a secure, password-protected computer system at Queen’s University. No unauthorized person will have access to the data generated by this study. Your digital data will never be linked with you by name, but only by a numeric code. Per Queen’s University policy, we must keep your data on file for 5 years. After 5 years, your digital file will be deleted from password-protected computers, and your data will be stored indefinitely in completely anonymous form that cannot be linked to your person using data archives such as the open science framework (https://osf.io/).</p>  
		<p><b>Can I remove my data from the experiment?</b>
        If you decide after the experiment that you do not want us to use your data, you may send Dr. Anita Tusche an email (see signature section below for contact information) and ask to have your data removed from the study. We will remove all your digital and computerized data that is stored in anonymous form (that cannot be linked to your name) from relevant data servers and from further analyses. If you decide to withdraw, you will still be compensated for any time you have spent participating in the experiment.</p>  
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Your consent to participate will be given by clicking on the ‘I wish to proceed’ button at the bottom of this page. You have not waived any legal rights by consenting to participate in this study.</p>  
		<p>If at any time you have further questions or concerns about this study, please contact Dr. Anita Tusche (Principal Investigator) at experiments.queens.neuroeconlab@gmail.com or anita.tusche@queensu.ca. If I have questions regarding my rights as a research participant or any ethic concerns, I can contact the Queen’s University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board (HSREB) at 1-844-535-2988 (Toll free in North America) or email HSREB@queensu.ca.
