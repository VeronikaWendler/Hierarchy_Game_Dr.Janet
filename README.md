# Hierarchy_Game_For_Dr.Janet
This is a scoial hierarchy game that assesses participants economic self- and other related choices which my mentor Dr. Remi Janet designed. I programmed the application in the framework of a pilot study. Hereby, we are testing whether emotional faces (perceived trustwothieness and dominance) mitigate the frequency of  gnerous choices.
