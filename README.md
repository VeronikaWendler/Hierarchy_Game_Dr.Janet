# Hierarchy_Game_For_Dr.Janet
This is a social hierarchy game that assesses participants' economic self- and other-related choices, which my mentor, Dr. Remi Janet, designed. I programmed the application within the framework of a pilot study. Hereby, we are testing whether emotional faces (perceived trustworthiness and dominance) mitigate the frequency of generous choices.
